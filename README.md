Modularity in Software Design
Modularity is a design principle that divides a software system into distinct, self-contained units or modules, each with a specific responsibility. Each module encapsulates a portion of the system's functionality and interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces.

Key Characteristics of Modularity
Cohesion:

Modules should have high internal cohesion, meaning the elements within a module are closely related and work together to achieve a specific function.
Coupling:

Modules should have low coupling, meaning the dependencies between modules are minimized. This ensures that changes in one module have little impact on others.
Encapsulation:

Each module should hide its internal implementation details and expose only what is necessary through its interface.
Reusability:

Modules can be reused across different parts of the system or in different projects, reducing redundancy and development time.
